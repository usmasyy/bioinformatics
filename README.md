# Bioinformatics-Based Decision Support System for Malaria, Dengue, COVID-19, and Typhoid

## Overview

This project presents a **Bioinformatics-Based Decision Support System (BBDSS)** designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing malaria, dengue, COVID-19, and typhoid fever. Utilizing global alignment algorithms, the system analyzes user-selected symptoms to determine the most likely disease. Developed in Python, this tool aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical settings.

## Features

- **Disease Diagnosis**: Users can input symptoms and receive predictions for malaria, dengue, COVID-19, and typhoid.
- **Global Alignment Algorithms**: The system employs advanced algorithms for sequence alignment to compare user symptoms with benchmark sequences for each disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use, allowing healthcare professionals to quickly input data and interpret results.
- **Expert System Integration**: Incorporates an expert system that utilizes IF-THEN rules for decision-making based on symptom analysis.
